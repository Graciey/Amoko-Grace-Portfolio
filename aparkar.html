            <h3 class="fw-bold">Introduction</h3>
            <p class="fs-5">Imagine you are new to an environment and you need a place to park your vehicle? You don't need to panick, all you need is Aparkar app at this time to solve this problem. </p>
            <p class="fs-5">Aparker is a mobile application used by a community of users called “Aparker” which is used to find a parking lot. Finding a place to park your vehicle can be a challenge i.e non availability of park space in a lot, getting an authorized place to park your vehicle and fear of your vehicle been stolen.</p>
            
            <p class="fs-5">This project was planned and executed by the Aparker team and myself. As a UI/UX Designer, my role was to conduct user research and create a clean and simple clickable mobile app.</p>
            <!-- <h3 class="fw-bold">Goal</h3>

            <h5 class="fw-bold">Research into the problem</h5>
            <!-- <p class="fs-5">Aparker is a mobile application used by a community of users called “Aparker” it is used to find directions and a parking lot. One of the greatest challenges one can frequently encounter is finding where you can park your car.</p> -->
            <!-- <p class="fs-5"><span class="fw-bold">i. Finding a parking lot:</span> One of the most common problems today is finding a place  to park your car. Finding a place to park your car isn’t easy if you are new to a particular environment, not only find a space but a safe place to park your car and also getting direction in order to locate the lot.</p>
            <p class="fs-5"><span class="fw-bold">ii. Knowing if a park is available:</span> Another pressing problem is gettinh to a parking lot, hoping it will be free but
                found out is filled up, nothing can be disheartening than this.</p> -->
            <p class="fs-5">I had a discussion with the owner of the app, to get what He expect this app to achieve in the long run, from our discussion the app is not in line with the B2C(Business to consumer) goal.</p>
            <p class="fs-5">The owner wants an application that can suggest the closest parking lot to it users, give the user an option to pick between a paid lot or a free lot</p>
            <p class="fs-5">After getting the B2C goal, i decided to get users feedback also, I also realized that the user's wants to get direction to a park, get estimation time for arrival to the park</p>
           
        </div>
        <div class="pb-4">
            <h3 class="fw-bold">Solution</h3>
            <!-- <p class="fs-5">The goal of this project is to re-design, improve the user experience, and also to enhance the app.</p> -->
            <p class="fs-5">After I have gotten the B2C goal and what the user wants, i started looking for a way to meet the users' need and the business owner needs at an equillibrum. I looked up for other similar app that does the same function as this app, to get some ideas.</p>
            <p class="fs-5">I came up with a full fledge mobile application that will conveniently proffer solution to the problem.</p>
            <!-- <p class="fs-5">Now am sure you probably want to know what was achieved by redesigning the app. After reviewing the user feedbacks, we had to sit and rethink how we can meet the need of the users. We came up a full fledge mobile application, which will give the user the priviledge to conveniently find a parking lot and also address the challenge stated above. </p> -->
           

            <p class="fs-5">The new improvement the has are listed below</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="fs-5">Make payment for a paid lot</li>
                <li class="fs-5">Suggest closest parking lot</li>
                <li class="fs-5">Give direction to it user</li>
