            <h3 class="fw-bold">Introduction</h3>
            <p class="fs-5">Paying of bill is one of the everyday activities humans do, you can’t do a day without paying one bill or 
                the other, there will always be a bill to pay for.</p>
            <p class="fs-5">Payer is an E-wallet mobile application used for paying bills, transfering and withdrawing money without
                stresss.  With this app, you can automate your regular bill payment i.e you don’t have to manually pay your
                bill, what you just have to do is to programme your monthly payment or yearly payment and the app 
                makes payment from your wallet.</p>
            <!-- <p class="fs-5">The goal of this project was to create a digital e-Wallet from where you can pay your bills, store banking 
                card, easily track your expenses and also to automatically pay some bill in the future.</p> -->
            <p class="fs-5">This project was planned and executed by myself. As a UI/UX Designer, my role was to conduct user 
                experience (UX) research and create a clean and simple clickable mobile app.</p>

            <h3 class="fw-bold">Challenge</h3>
            <h5 class="fw-bold">Research into the problem</h5>
            <p class="fs-5">
                There are a lot of E-wallet app on playstore which are really nice, but they all do not have the feature of automatically paying some fixed bill i.e paying of electricty bill, internet 
                subscription, house rent e.t.c. </p>
                <!-- <p class="fs-5">
                  Ability to withdraw from wallet</p> -->
            <!-- <p class="fs-5">One of the challenge this project aims to tackles is to manage the repeating the same routing over and over again
                i.e having to pay regular bill, which you can just automate the payment i.e paying of electricty bill, internet 
                subscription and others.</p> -->
            <!-- <p class="fs-5">I also went ahead to conduct some user survey trying to know what people will like an E-wallet app to consist 
                people will also love to have a seamless transaction to their loved ones using this app.</p> -->
        </div>
        <div class="pb-4">
            <h3 class="fw-bold">Solution</h3>
            <p class="fs-5">I came up with a full fledge mobile application, with this app you can pay your bills, store banking 
                card, easily track your expenses and also automatically pay some bill in the future.</p>
            <!-- <p class="fs-5">A digital E-wallet app was created, from where you can pay your bills, store banking 
                card, easily track your expenses and also to automatically pay some bill in the future.</p> -->
            <!-- <p class="fs-5">I conducted some user research, i was able to deduce that most people will love to pay bill and have their regular
                bill payment to be automated like internet subscription, house rent e.t.c. and also be able to transfer money to their
                loved ones. Provide a secured account for carrying out transactions. This have will help keep track of your transactions.</p> -->
        </div>
        <!-- <h4 class="pb-4">“How do we  achieve this in it simplest form, having the user at heart?”</h4> -->
        <div class="pb-4">
            <h3 class="fw-bold">User Flow</h3>

        <div class="pb-4">
            <h3 class="fw-bold">Wireframes</h3>
            <p class="fs-5">After the user flow has been created, I was able to conceptualize and come up with an idea on how to create an interactive components which will enable the user to achieve the purpose for which the app was created for.</p>
